**Project Description** - This repo contains the code to the Weather Forecast Website that can be used to check hourly weather and the weather forecast for the upcoming days at different locations in the world. When the user enters a city name, they will be able to check the local temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature of the day along with the general description of the weather like cloudy/windy/misty etc. Additionally, they will be able to see the predicted weather for the next 5 days. 

**Technologies used** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Framework used** - React

**3rd party API used** - Weather DB. It is a free to use weather API that provides **hourly** weather updates and the weather forecast for the upcoming days. It requires no API key. 

**Commit history** - 

**First major commit (4/10/2022)** - Created the blueprint for the UI, global context provider and displayed current weather. 

**Second major commit (18/10/2022)** - Added the loader for user experience (UX), added functionality of displaying weather data information about a location according to user input.

**Third major commit (19/10/2022)** - Completed the UI, which shows the current weather and predicted weather for the next 5 days.  

**Issues/Bugs** - 

**1. OpenWeatherMap API** - The free version of OpenWeatherMap API doesn't contain the data for weather forecast of upcoming days and its weather icons are not clear at all. Because of this, I switched to Weather DB which has more useful data that can be used.
